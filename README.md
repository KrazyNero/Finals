A website similar to Spotify.

<hr>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Simple user login/register will suffice and also need a documentation for the website.</li>
	<li>It must be responsive and mobile friendly website.</li>
	<li>A documentation for the website</li>
	
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Optional</h2>
<p>Instead of using local music, use the youtube api instead. Though it needs wifi and proper api implementation for it to work.</p>
<p>Dark mode feature (should not be that hard)</p>
<p>Users can post music, like, rate, and make a playlist</p>

<hr>

UI/GUI will be similar to Spotify albeit not a 1 to 1 copy. 

The goal should be:

1. A decent UI, with responsiveness and mobile friendly.
2. Able to play music, locally or through APIs.
3. Other basic functionality of a music streaming service.
